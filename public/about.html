	<h1> About Us </h1>

	<div id="paragraph1">This is a supportive story-sharing community focused on socially stigmatized issues, such as HIV, Homelessness, and Domestic Violence. People suffering from these mental/physical problems can often feel isolated and depressed. So this community provides a safe-space where users can help other users by anonymously sharing their heart-warming stories around the same issue.<br>You know why? Because no one deserves to feel alone!</div>
	</body>

	<div id="notice">Note: This website is NOT an alternative to therapy and counseling, etc. Nor is it supposed to be that way. It is just a welcoming and friendly environment to make the social stigmas around health issues easier to handle. Also, encouraging to get help from professionals.</div>
